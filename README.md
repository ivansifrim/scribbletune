This program uses Scribbletune and it's for composers. It solves the problem of writing a good rhythmic pattern without knowing what the notes for it will be. 

Based on a rhytmic pattern and a selection of notes, the program will generate a midi file containing multiple variations. Some of them could end up working well for your rhythmic pattern.


To get started: 

```javascript
npm install

node app.js
```

A file called ideas.mid will be created. 
You can open that file in your favorite audio editor (Logic, GarageBand, etc).
