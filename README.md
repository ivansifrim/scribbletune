This program allows us to hear different variations of notes for a rhythmic pattern that we created.
It will export a midi file that we can then listen to and check if any idea generated was good enough to keep working on.


To get started: 

```javascript
npm install

node app.js
```

A file called new_midi_file.mid will be created. 
You can open that file in your favorite audio editor (Logic, GarageBand, etc).
